# UK-OMOP
A directory of OMOP CDM data sets in the UK.
The aim of this page is to create a table of OMOP projects and data sets in the UK. This table will be displayed in the HDR Alliance web pages. The aim is to signpost OMOP resources in the UK, rather than to replace sites such as the EHDEN Portal and the HDR Innovation Gateway.
The data was collected as part of a survey of OMOP activity in the UK.
The intention is that bymaking this accessible on GitHub that organisations can amend their own data, if desired.
